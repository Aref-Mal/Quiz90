# Project Accessibility Report

Equitable Use


We can make our program more accessible to people all around the world by adding language options to our trivia application.
To further promote equitable use, we can implement customizable font sizes, including larger fonts for users with visual impairments. Additionally, we can add specialized fonts like OpenDyslexic for individuals with dyslexia and Bionic Reading font to improve readability and focus for users with ADHD, ensuring our program accommodates diverse visual and cognitive needs.




Flexibility in Use


Users can choose from several categories (general knowledge, history, etc.) and difficulty settings (e.g., easy, medium, hard), allowing them to play a quiz that matches their interests, knowledge, and ability. This feature accommodates both novice and advanced users, making the program more versatile, depending on their area of expertise.
Additional features like customizable colour themes (light mode, dark mode, and high-contrast mode) to accommodate users with visual impairments or sensitivity to bright screens may be added in the future.
Adding a “Play as Guest” button in the future will allow users to access the program without the need to create an account. This is a feature we were hoping to implement but could not because we ran out of time




Simple and Intuitive Use


Quiz90 incorporates a clear and minimalist user interface design, featuring clean layouts and familiar design elements that allow users to easily locate and understand various features.
The buttons and components of the program are organized in a logical order, ensuring that navigation is straightforward, even for first-time users.




Perceptible Information


Quiz 90 provides clear feedback to users, such as changing button colours when selected.
A summary view at the end of the quiz indicates the user's score and highlights the correct answers, ensuring that the user can easily review their performance.
A progress bar showing the number of completed questions and a real-time score indicator could be added, allowing users to track their progress throughout the quiz.
