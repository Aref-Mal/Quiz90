# Project Accessibility Report

## Principles of Universal Design

**Equitable Use**

- We can make our program more accessible to people all around the world by adding language options to our trivia application.
- To further promote equitable use, we can implement customizable font sizes, including larger fonts for users with visual impairments. Additionally, we can add specialized fonts like OpenDyslexic for individuals with dyslexia and Bionic Reading font to improve readability and focus for users with ADHD, ensuring our program accommodates diverse visual and cognitive needs.

**Flexibility in Use**

- Users can choose from several categories (general knowledge, history, etc.) and difficulty settings (e.g., easy, medium, hard), allowing them to play a quiz that matches their interests, knowledge, and ability. This feature accommodates both novice and advanced users, making the program more versatile, depending on their area of expertise.
- Additional features like customizable colour themes (light mode, dark mode, and high-contrast mode) to accommodate users with visual impairments or sensitivity to bright screens may be added in the future.
- Adding a “Play as Guest” button in the future will allow users to access the program without the need to create an account. This is a feature we were hoping to implement but could not because we ran out of time

**Simple and Intuitive Use**

- Quiz90 incorporates a clear and minimalist user interface design, featuring clean layouts and familiar design elements that allow users to easily locate and understand various features.
The buttons and components of the program are organized in a logical order, ensuring that navigation is straightforward, even for first-time users.

**Perceptible Information**

- Quiz 90 provides clear feedback to users, such as changing button colours when selected.
- A summary view at the end of the quiz indicates the user's score and highlights the correct answers, ensuring that the user can easily review their performance.
- A progress bar showing the number of completed questions and a real-time score indicator could be added, allowing users to track their progress throughout the quiz.

**Tolerance for Error**

- Quiz 90’s UI relies on buttons for answering multiple choice questions and drop-down menus for selecting categories, difficulty levels, and the number of questions, reducing the risk of errors such as misspellings or invalid inputs compared to text fields.
- Currently, the program registers a player's first click as their selected answer, which increases the likelihood of accidental selection. To reduce this, we could implement a "Submit" button for each question, allowing users to confirm their choice before it is finalized.

**Low Physical Effort**

- The Low Physical Effort principle does not apply to Quiz90, as the interactions are simple, requiring the minimal physical effort of clicking to navigate/lock in an answer. There are no complex navigation or physically demanding actions needed.

**Size and Space for Approach and Use**

- This principle does not apply to Quiz 90 since it is designed to work within a standard screen size, and no extreme physical space or special accommodations are required. The interface elements like buttons are sized for typical interactions, and users can use the program on any device with basic screen resolution.

## Target Audience

- If we were to market our Quiz 90, it would be aimed at students, educators, and people who games and are interested in improving their knowledge in specific subjects. This group includes students who use quizzes as part of their study routines or want to create/share a quiz related to one of their courses as a fun way to review for tests. Furthermore, teachers can use Quiz90 as a tool to test and assess their students’ knowledge. Additionally, the program could appeal to anyone looking for a fun, interactive way to learn new things.

## Excluded Audience

- Quiz 90 may have limited use among certain demographics, such as older adults who may not be as familiar with digital learning tools or those who are not as comfortable using technology. Additionally, users with disabilities, particularly those who require screen readers or other accessibility tools, might find it challenging if the program’s interface does not support those technologies. Moving forward, we can focus on improving accessibility features to ensure that our program is usable by a broader audience.
